# POC: BPMN2CAMEL
Proof of Concept [On Progress] : BPMN2CAMEL

Enterprise integration pattern(EIP) is used to connect end-applications that can talk among themselves with same or different protocols.
While connecting the end-applications, a work-flow is realized. These work-flow are executed by CAMEL API in java world. CAMEL API is specizialized for realizing all possible EIPs (to connect applications)

To create a dynamic CAMEL-ROUTE, an end-user could define them using BPMN. Camunda BPMN modeler comes in two forms: desktop app or web-app.
Once the model of connectivity is defined by end-user, then this BPMN-XML generated by moderler can be used converted to CAMEL-ROUTE XML. 

The CAMEL-ROUTE XML can now be fed to CAMEL API and end to end-connectivity between different applications can be realized

In this repository there is a crude attempt to MAP the BPMN_XML to CAMEL_ROUTE XML.

CAMEL_ROUTE XML can be fed to CAMEL API. As CAMEL API is written using JAVA-API, feeding it using an agnositic programming language independent XML configuration as CAMEL_ROUTE XML, is therefore, a good approach
